If there is one myth that I try and rail against, it's the idea creativity and ingenuity are inherent talents you _just have_ rather than skills you can train and improve. In fact I'd go as far as arguing that training these skills can be incredibly useful, both inside and outside of work.

This article is mostly through the lens of a software engineer, however there won't be big chunks of code or technical jargon thrown around, so it should be relatable for anyone.

## Dumb Things

Writing this because I've been building a website for ranking mince pies, which absolutely falls into this camp, but I wanted to examine why I felt so driven and energised doing it, and really felt I was learning, rather than just accepting it was the case like previous projects.

Whats a dumb thing, examples

- it was not a manual
- mince pie rank
- quoteposters
- N64 Adapter
- openskull
- various bits of the homelab

It's important that it's dumb because it's unique, but also has no pressure

This also helps treat the whole thing as a pet tinkering project

## Quickly

Quickly feels like it'd make things worse, but it's incredibly liberating knowing you can just drop the thing when it is "finished" or you're bored of it.

Game jams are a great example of this. Knowing when to finish is the hardest thing on any creative endeavour - you can always do more, always iterate more, always produce more, but sometimes you just gotta ship the thing and hope for the best.

The idea is to learn from mistakes without having to be burdened by them.

## For No Reason

This is probably the most important part - you can't walk in expecting the project to be more than a throwaway curiosity

Attaching goals is great, but they should be similary in the camp of a "dumb thing quickly for no reason". Trying to get x eyeballs on something by hook or by crook in a weekend sounds fun - coming up with a plan to develop x Monthly active users sounds boring

Nothing sucks the passion out of a project quicker than it being extrinsicly motivated - and you're trying to nurture intrinsic skills anyway

Aside - No Reason isn't quite the same as Useless. If there is something you want to do that's useful to you and you think will be a fun pet project, that's an incredible thing to chase (food diary).

## Follow the Fun

To call it back to gamejams, there is a phrase thrown around - "Follow the fun". When you're looking at something you think could be fun, start following it. Then just keep moving through from point-to-point of fun.
